# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

 I feel rather confident. Unlike a lot of the other material that been covered I understand the 'why' surrounding for which is a big help for me. I understand whats happening in the code when we iterate and I understand its value in programming.


- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I felt great! Like I've mentioned previously I was fortunate to have practiced for loops before coming into mod 0 so this was more of a refresher and I'm glad I could shake off some rust.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need practice with different final expressions. The for loops I've worked with before have only been i++ or i-- so it was definitely a curveball having to figure out how to utilize those.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Like aI mentioned above I definitely want to play around with different final expression and become comfortable with them, in order to to do that I'll play around with them more in replit
